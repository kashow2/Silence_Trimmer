ffmpeg_trim --- script that performs the silence trimming from audio files.
  Uses a function trim_silence which takes three arguments, the directory input folder, the directory output folder and the course associated with the audio files.

dashboard --- main executable script that will open a dashboard prompting users to select the input folder with all audio files of interest,
  the output folder to save resulting files and allow the user to render the audio!
  Uses tkinter library for the dashboard creation.

AudioTrim_Classes --- text file with nested dictionary holding the metadata information associated with the audio files desired to be trimmed.


IMPORTANT NOTES:
-  Need to place the input and output folders for the audio files within the same working directory of this program, along with both programs and the Classes.txt file.
-  Must download ffmpeg.exe from the web (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and place ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe and ffprobe.exe into your working Path.
-  [On Windows] Your Path can be found by searching Path in the Windows search bar, navigating to the Advanced tab of system properties and going into Environmental Variables.
-  On line 11 of the dashboard.py script, you need to change the file_path variable to where you've stored the AudioTrim_Classes.txt file!
